# k-means-image-contour-detector
This project was developed as part of the subject VC (Computer Vision) at FIB - UPC Barcelona, using Matlab. It implements a system for segmenting objects in images using the K-means clustering algorithm. The system allows users to manually indicate the object to segment with a rectangular box, and then segments it, marking its outline in red.
